# Q.2.Write a Python program to convert a list to a tuple. 
#     Input: listx = [5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]


# Define a list with multiple elements
listx = [5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]

# Convert the list to a tuple
convert_tuple = tuple(listx)

# Print the result
print(f"Given list can be converted and the result is: {convert_tuple}")
